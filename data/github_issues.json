Since version 3.0.0, Luos have been unleashed and able to run anywhere and use any network.\nHistorically to manage timestamping Luos was considering that no synchronization was available among the nodes. This is not true anymore because some advanced network can rely on time synchronization.\nDescribe the expected behavior of the feature\nTo be able to benefits from these synchronized network we have to be able to remove the latency based timestamping and use a plain date instead. This need to be a phy choice depending on it's capabilities.\nthis will be a boolean value stored in the luos_phy_t struct. This boolean will change the behavior of the Phy_ComputeMsgTimestamp, instead of computing the differential value we will just return the plain timestamp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions",

        "description": "Which version the bug has been detected\nLuos engine 2.5.2\nDescribe the bug\nAfter a while (several minutes), random services on the network stop receiving messages from the Gate.\nEach PCB features a LED that is lit up for one second after every command message (power_ratio) is received from the Gate. This is why I am sure that the services stop receiving commands from the Gate.\nThe services continue to send data to the Gate though. Each service generates non static data that is properly received by PyLuos.\nNetwork configuration\nIt is the same configuration as in #308.\nThe image below shows the network made of one Gate + Pipe (NUCLEO-G431KB with custom shield) and 25 custom nodes (STM32G431KB based), each one hosting one custom ServoMotor service.\nThe Gate + Pipe are powered through the USB cable. Each motor control node is powered (12 V regulated down to 3.3 V by each PCB) through the harness visible in the middle of the image (U shape).\n\nThe list of nodes and services is the following:\n

After restarting the test without rebooting the system, the last 5 services stop receiving data after a couple seconds. Rebooting the Gate changed nothing, but rebooting the servomotor services allowed the system to work for several minutes before encountering the same issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions",

        "description": "Which version the bug has been detected\nLuos engine 2.5.2\nDescribe the bug\nWhen exactly 25 nodes (in addition to the one hosting the gate and the pipe) are on the network, pyluos-bootloader fails to flash the last one of them (node ID 26), stopping at 3% of progress, when the nodes have just been flashed with the boot_service through a ST-LINK probe. This behaviour is always the same, no matter if I try to flash all nodes together or only the last node. I can reboot the network, switch the boards in the network, ..., it is always node with ID 26 that will be stuck at 3% of flashing.\nIf I isolate a subsection of the network, let's say nodes with ID 20 to 26, by disconnecting the rest of the boards, I can then flash all 7 boards normally. When I put this subsection back into the network, everything then works perfectly: I can reprogram the whole network using pyluos-bootloader.\nNetwork configuration\nThe image below shows the network made of one Gate + Pipe (NUCLEO-G431KB with custom shield) and 25 custom nodes (STM32G431KB based), each one hosting one custom ServoMotor service.\nThe Gate + Pipe are powered through the USB cable. Each motor control node is powered (12 V regulated down to 3.3 V by each PCB) through the harness visible in the middle of the image (U shape).\n\nThe list of nodes and services is the following:\n

If they do that the code become unsafe because the value will be stored with an unknown unit(or only known by the developer). OD structures should be always written using the dedicated functions forcing users to specify the used unit.\nTo do that I propose to modify the OD structure by adding a layer with a reserved var.\nFor example, instead of :\ntypedef float angular_position_t;\n\nWe should do:\ntypedef struct{\n    float private;\n} angular_position_t;\n\nThis way, to access the value, users have to do My_var.private = 10. This should convince them not to and to use functions instead.\nAll the functions of the OD will be able to use the private var to write or return a converted value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions",

So, to get started with this technology, you will need at least a computer and a supported dev board.\nFind a board and plug it can be a drop condition for a new user.\nThe Native support goal is to allow people to test the technology without needing anything other than a computer.\nThis issue will be considered closed when all the training tutorials will be completely compatible with a Native target.\nConstraints\nThe way things work has to be as close as it is when we use it on embedded targets.\nWe will have to keep the Luos_engine code base clean. No exception on this part of the code will be allowed. The only place where we can do native-specific things is on HAL and service code.\nHere is a Global representation of Luos_engine layers :\n\nCreating a Luos engine Core HAL will be straightforward. We only need a systick and can ignore Flash management for now because the bootloader is not part of the training tutorial yet.\nToday, there is only one available network called Robus. This network has been thought to work on a half-duplex serial network, so we will have to create a native HAL for Robus to emulate this serial connection through TCP/IP.\nWe will have to create a specific native HAL (in green) like that :\n\nLuos define a node as an MCU on the network. In the native target, we could have multiple binaries running on the same CPU; each running binary will be considered a node.\nUsed protocols\nData exchange\nRobus rely on multipoint broadcast communication. Every message sent will be received by every node on the network simultaneously (by neglecting propagation time). We will have to emulate this by broadcasting information to every service available on the network.\nWe will use the WebSocket protocol to send and receive information. WebSocket will allow us to be future-proof and to make things run on web interfaces.\nDiscovering\nLuos also need to be able to detect other nodes on the network. Robus use PTP lines to manage and find the topology. Those PTP lies allow us to daisy chain the nodes and to know which node is connected to which node, giving us a deterministic topology of the system.\nBecause native target nodes are binary and not physical parts, we can't use any physical specificities to create a deterministic topology. We will have to find another way.\nFor now, Luos and Robus are still highly coupled, and the way Luos works could be a problem for this detection feature. We will probably have to do some dirty hacks to make it work. This is ok only if we keep it on services and HAL.\nMdns is massively used to declare a service on a TCP/IP network. We could use that.\nPear to Pear libraries seems to be able to discover pears and create a list sorted by \"distance\". This list could be deterministic... Those libs also deal with pear data exchange.\nDevelopment steps\nBefore a complete setup, we must be able to compile a minimal Luos_engine binary working on a native target.\nStep 1:\nSo the first step will be to compile an example only using localhost (internal to the binary) communication.\nThis step has its issue with more details: #290\nStep 2:\nThen we can actually work on developing a native HAL able to communicate on the Robus HAL.\nThis step has its issue with more details: #291\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions",

We consider the step 1 ( #290 ) as completed\nOr final goal will be to have the button running on another node that the Gate and still be able to catch it on the pyluos side :\n\nTo do that, our main focus will be on the Robus HAL.\nCommunication\nTo exchange information it could be great to rely on WebSocket and to be able to broadcast to all off them information. For broadcasting we could use MQTT with a broadcast topic.\nThis part is open to contribution and brainstorming\nDetection\nWe will need to find a way to list other services and to send them node ID. To send them Id we need to be able to send a non broadcast message. If We use MQTT each node could create a topic with it's node name allowing anyone to reach this specific service.\nThis part is open to contribution and brainstorming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions",

We will avoid the flash functions for now because we don't need to support the bootloader feature yet. In the future, we could emulate the flash with a file and be able to execute it (see #289 ).\nRobus HAL\nFor this first step, in this HAL, we only need to fake message transmissions. Other functions can be void.\nButton\nThe button service will use the space key of the keyboard to change its state.\nGate and Inspector\nGate and Inspector are app services. They don't rely on any hardware. Meaning they can be compiled and work without any modifications.\nPipe\nGate/Inspector will use Pipe to exchange information with pyluos. We will have to make this Pipe use WebSocket instead of the classical Serial communication. This work will be usable for the development of the Robus Native HAL on step 2 of the native development.\nAlso, this Pipe could be able to declare itself on the network allowing pyluos to discover the available pipe on the network (see #288 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions",

That is to say, a service has demanded to receive all the messages of a specif service, or every service. However in this function there is a case that we do not double allocate the message, if this message is indeed destined to this specific service.\nTo avoid double allocating the same message for the same service, we compare the ID of the filter disable service with the msg->header.target.

        "description": "What feature would you like to be included in Luos?\nWe need to create a #define for the size of an application in number of sectors. So when the user uses a bootloader to flash an mcu, we will directly know the sector that the application is stored and the number of sectors used to store this application. This will be really useful for the flash Erase function.\nRight now we assume that the Application binary is positioned after all the other bytes (bootloader, shared memory etc) and that we need to erase the last sectors in order to erase the application. This will not always be true, as the user has access to the parameters APP_ADDRESS, APP_ADDRESS_SECTOR, SHARED_MEMORY_SECTOR etc, so they can easily change the order of their position in flash. As a result it is not sure that the sectors we decide to erase in HAL do not contain data of the other partitions of memory, data that we may want to continue having stored.\nBy putting a default application size, and by motivating the user to redefine the size depending on their needs, we can reassure the well-functioning of Luos (and particularly in the case of a bootloader, that is the case that we erase some sectors of flash).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions",

        "description": "What feature would you like to be included in Luos?\nAn existing feature of Luos which is the subscription of aliases in flash memory should be deleted from Luos_engine, because it poses problems in the  writing of applications in flash and in the functionality of bootloader.\n-Right now we reserve the last sector of the flash for the aliases that we may have defined, and that we may want to use in the future. However, it is not a functionality that is frequently needed by the users, and it is needed only in very specific projects (like in projects with numerous hot-pluged services of the same name, etc).\nProblems:\n->Up till now, as the aliases were saved in the last sector of flash, we didnt erase this sector. This causes a problem, if while using a bootloader we flash with an application binary that uses the last sector to be saved. For example a long binary application that takes maltiple sectors in order to be saved, or the example of NUCLEO-F410RB that we save directly the binary in the last flash sector. In other words, the flash of the application is not well-cleaned so the application upload fails.\n->In the same condition with the previous problem, we can overwrite the aliases with an application, or we can overwrite some application bytes, with the aliases that are saved during the execution.\nSolution\nThe best solution is to leave this feature in the users' decision. If users, developping a specific project, need to store the aliases of their services, they should write them into flash in the specific address that they want, into their user code.  So Luos will not handle the treatment of aliases, it will only change the alias in ram and it will not store it in flash.\nThe message of WRITE_ALIAS that may be sent by pyluos to the network in order to rename a service, should pass by Luos like before, so that Luos change the name of the service in the service structure, but it should also be transferred to the service. So if the user wants to stock this alias in flash, they can do it, otherwise the message will be dropped.\nFor the treatment of write alias message, as well as the writing of an alias in flash, it would be nice that we propose a tutorial, so that we could facilitate the process, and propose a solution for those that they need to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions",
